# unsupervised-learning-on-songs-data


The data contains over 5k songs with the information about "artist","link of the songs","name of the song","song text"

Based on the text of the songs data, I separted the songs into different groups by using K means clustering model and used dimension reduction
tools such as LSA to 50 features and 2 features separately and visulize the words from each group by using word cloud.
